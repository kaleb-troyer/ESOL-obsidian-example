I went ahead and put together examples with code for how I use obsidian for time tracking + a few other examples. 

To install obsidian, go to: https://obsidian.md/download

1)	Download the repo as a zip. 
2)	Unzip the repository wherever. 
3)	Rename the “obsidian properties” folder to “.obsidian” (GitHub didn’t like a file beginning with ‘.’)
4)	Download and install obsidian. 
5)	Launch obsidian > go to “create new vault” > go to “browse” and navigate to wherever you unzipped the repo. 

I set everything up to work out of the box, so it should be ready to go for you at this point. If you’re having problems, let me know. I’d be more than happy to help anyone get it set up.
